## 🛠️ How I Built This

I created this project from scratch with the goal of learning how to build a simple personal webpage using just HTML and CSS.

### Steps I followed:

1. **Planned the sections** I wanted to include:
   - Introduction (Who I am)
   - About me
   - Contact info
   - Skills & Achievements

2. **Created an `index.html` file** to hold the structure of the webpage.

3. **Styled it using `style.css`**:
   - Used basic layout styling (padding, colors, fonts)
   - Made sure the design looks clean and readable

4. **Tested it locally** on my browser to ensure everything works fine.
